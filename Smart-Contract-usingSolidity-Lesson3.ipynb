    "\n",
    "Up until now, Solidity has looked quite similar to other languages like JavaScript. But there are a number of ways that Ethereum DApps are actually quite different from normal applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, after you deploy a contract to Ethereum, it’s immutable, which means that it can never be modified or updated again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial code you deploy to a contract is there to stay, permanently, on the blockchain. This is one reason security is such a huge concern in Solidity. If there's a flaw in your contract code, there's no way for you to patch it later. You would have to tell your users to start using a different smart contract address that has the fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is also a feature of smart contracts. The code is law. If you read the code of a smart contract and verify it, you can be sure that every time you call a function it's going to do exactly what the code says it will do. No one can later change that function and give you unexpected results.\n",
    "### External dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lesson 2, we hard-coded the CryptoKitties contract address into our DApp. But what would happen if the CryptoKitties contract had a bug and someone destroyed all the kitties?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's unlikely, but if this did happen it would render our DApp completely useless — our DApp would point to a hardcoded address that no longer returned any kitties. Our zombies would be unable to feed on kitties, and we'd be unable to modify our contract to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, it often makes sense to have functions that will allow you to update key portions of the DApp.\n",

In this case, onlyOwner can be used to limit access so only the owner of the contract can run this function. We'll talk more about function modifiers in the next chapter, and what that weird _; does.\n",
    "- indexed keyword: don't worry about this one, we don't need it yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the Ownable contract basically does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a contract is created, its constructor sets the owner to msg.sender (the person who deployed it)\n",
    "\n",

    "Let's look at another way Solidity is quite different from other programming languages:\n",
    "### Gas — the fuel Ethereum DApps run on\n",
    "\n",
    "In Solidity, your users have to pay every time they execute a function on your DApp using a currency called gas. Users buy gas with Ether (the currency on Ethereum), so your users have to spend ETH in order to execute functions on your DApp.\n",
    "\n",
    "How much gas is required to execute a function depends on how complex that function's logic is. Each individual operation has a gas cost based roughly on how much computing resources will be required to perform that operation (e.g. writing to storage is much more expensive than adding two integers). The total gas cost of your function is the sum of the gas costs of all its individual operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because running functions costs real money for your users, code optimization is much more important in Ethereum than in other programming languages. If your code is sloppy, your users are going to have to pay a premium to execute your functions — and this could add up to millions of dollars in unnecessary fees across thousands of users.\n",
    "### Why is gas necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum is like a big, slow, but extremely secure computer. When you execute a function, every single node on the network needs to run that same function to verify its output — thousands of nodes verifying every function execution is what makes Ethereum decentralized, and its data immutable and censorship-resistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The creators of Ethereum wanted to make sure someone couldn't clog up the network with an infinite loop, or hog all the network resources with really intensive computations. So they made it so transactions aren't free, and users have to pay for computation time as well as storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note: This isn't necessarily true for sidechains, like the ones the CryptoZombies authors are building at Loom Network. It probably won't ever make sense to run a game like World of Warcraft directly on the Ethereum mainnet — the gas costs would be prohibitively expensive. But it could run on a sidechain with a different consensus algorithm. We'll talk more about what types of DApps you would want to deploy on sidechains vs the Ethereum mainnet in a future lesson.\n",
